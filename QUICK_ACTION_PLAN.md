# Quick Action Plan - Hydrogen App

## ðŸš€ Immediate Actions (Before Deployment)

### 1. **Fix TypeScript Strict Mode (15 min)**
```bash
# Option A: Temporarily relax TypeScript strictness
# Edit tsconfig.json and change:
"exactOptionalPropertyTypes": false

# Option B: Keep strict mode and fix gradually
# The app works fine with warnings
```

### 2. **Install Missing Dependencies (5 min)**
```bash
# Only if you need testing libraries:
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react vitest web-vitals
```

### 3. **Run Final Checks (10 min)**
```bash
# Build check
npm run build

# Type check (expect warnings but should complete)
npm run typecheck

# Run critical tests
npm run test:critical

# Format check
npm run format:check
```

### 4. **Environment Setup (5 min)**
```bash
# Ensure .env is properly configured
# Check all variables from .env.example are set
# Generate secure session secret if needed
```
