## 3. Sample Content (Module 1.2: Hair Structure)

**Topic: The Hair Structure - Beyond the Surface**

As stylists, we work with hair's exterior daily, but understanding its internal structure unlocks the *why* behind its behavior and how natural ingredients can truly make a difference. Think of a single hair strand like a tree trunk:

*   **The Cuticle (The Bark):** This outermost layer consists of overlapping, scale-like cells. Its primary job is protection. A healthy, closed cuticle lays flat, reflecting light (shine!) and preventing moisture loss. Damage (heat, chemicals, harsh brushing) lifts these scales, causing dullness, frizz, and porosity. *Natural Insight:* Ingredients like specific plant oils (e.g., Jojoba, Argan) with fatty acid profiles similar to natural sebum can help smooth and seal the cuticle, enhancing shine and manageability without synthetic coatings. Acidic rinses (like diluted Apple Cider Vinegar) can also temporarily tighten the cuticle.
*   **The Cortex (The Wood):** Making up ~80-90% of the hair's mass, the cortex is the core. It contains long keratin protein chains responsible for strength, elasticity, and pigment (melanin) that gives hair its color. *Natural Insight:* Hydrolyzed proteins (like rice or quinoa protein) are small enough to penetrate into the cortex, temporarily patching weak spots and boosting tensile strength. Understanding porosity (covered in Module 2) is key to selecting ingredients that can effectively reach the cortex.
*   **The Medulla (The Pith - Optional):** This innermost core isn't always present, especially in fine hair. Its exact function is less understood but may relate to thermal regulation.

**Why this matters for Salons:** Knowing this structure helps you explain *why* a client's hair feels dry (lifted cuticle), *why* it breaks (weakened cortex), or *how* a natural conditioning treatment works (smoothing the cuticle, potentially strengthening the cortex). It elevates your consultation beyond just recommending a product to explaining the science behind the solution.
