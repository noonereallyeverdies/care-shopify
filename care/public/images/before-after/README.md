# Before-After Images

This directory contains the before and after treatment images used in the BeforeAfterGallery component.

## Implementation

These images are used with the `ReactCompareSlider` component which displays a slider that allows users to drag and compare the before and after states. The component takes two separate images (before and after) and creates an interactive slider interface.

## Naming Convention

- `before-after-1-before.jpg` - First testimonial's "before" image (left side of slider)
- `before-after-1-after.jpg` - First testimonial's "after" image (right side of slider)
- `before-after-2-before.jpg` - Second testimonial's "before" image
- `before-after-2-after.jpg` - Second testimonial's "after" image 
- `before-after-3-before.jpg` - Third testimonial's "before" image
- `before-after-3-after.jpg` - Third testimonial's "after" image

## Notes

- These images should be consistent in size and aspect ratio for the slider to work properly
- The slider works by showing part of the "before" image and part of the "after" image
- Users can drag the divider to see more of either side
- This approach makes the transformation more interactive and engaging

- These images should be properly licensed for commercial use
- The images were added to the gallery by user request
- The image dimensions should maintain consistent aspect ratios
