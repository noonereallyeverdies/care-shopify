# Performance Analysis & Optimization Plan

## Current Issues Identified

### 1. Dynamic Imports in Homepage Component
- BeforeAfterSliderSection and HairLossVisualization are dynamically imported with useState
- This creates unnecessary re-renders and complex state management
- Solution: Use React.lazy() with Suspense for cleaner code splitting

### 2. Large Framer Motion Bundle
- Framer Motion is imported fully in homepage
- Multiple motion components imported individually
- Solution: Import only needed parts and defer non-critical animations

### 3. Heavy Dependencies in Main Bundle
- Multiple icons imported from lucide-react
- All motion utilities loaded upfront
- Solution: Lazy load non-critical icons and animations

### 4. CSS Loading Strategy
- Multiple CSS files loaded synchronously
- No critical CSS inlining
- Solution: Implement critical CSS extraction and async loading

## Optimization Strategies

### Bundle Size Reduction
- Reduce main bundle by 30-40%
- Implement proper tree shaking
- Use dynamic imports strategically

### Runtime Performance
- Improve First Contentful Paint (FCP) by 25%
- Reduce Time to Interactive (TTI) by 30%
- Optimize Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

### Memory Optimization
- Reduce JavaScript heap size
- Optimize component re-renders
- Implement proper cleanup for animations
