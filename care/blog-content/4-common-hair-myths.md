## the truth about hair growth: beyond the old wives' tales

in our quest for healthier, thicker hair, we often encounter a dizzying array of advice—from grandmother's remedies to viral social media "hacks." but how much of this information is scientifically sound? at care<span style="color:#FF5A36; font-size:0.8em; vertical-align:top; margin-left:1px; margin-right:1px;">•</span>atin, we believe in evidence-based approaches to hair health, which is why we're tackling some of the most persistent myths about hair growth and care.

let's separate fact from fiction to help you make informed decisions about your hair care routine.

## myth #1: trimming your hair frequently makes it grow faster

**the myth**: regular haircuts stimulate growth, helping your hair grow faster and longer.

**the science**: hair grows from follicles located in the scalp, not from the ends. cutting the ends of your hair cannot influence the biological processes occurring at the root level. on average, hair grows about half an inch per month, and this rate is determined by genetics, age, overall health, and hormonal factors—not by how frequently you trim your ends.

**the truth**: while regular trims can prevent split ends from traveling up the hair shaft (which can make hair appear longer over time by preventing breakage), they don't actually increase your hair's growth rate. the perception of faster growth after trimming is simply that—a perception.

**what actually helps**: if you want to support your hair's natural growth rate, focus on scalp health, proper nutrition, and evidence-based treatments like red light therapy that stimulate the follicles where growth actually occurs.

## myth #2: brushing hair 100 strokes daily promotes growth

**the myth**: vigorous daily brushing stimulates the scalp, distributes oils, and promotes faster, healthier hair growth.

**the science**: while gentle brushing does help distribute natural oils from the scalp to the hair shaft, excessive brushing causes mechanical damage through friction. this can lead to cuticle damage, breakage, and hair loss—the opposite of the intended effect.

**the truth**: over-brushing actually damages hair and can contribute to thinning over time. the 100-strokes myth dates back to a time when people washed their hair infrequently, and brushing helped distribute sebum through the hair.

**what actually helps**: brush gently and only as needed to detangle or style. use a wide-tooth comb or a brush designed to minimize breakage, especially when hair is wet and most vulnerable to damage.

## myth #3: inversion therapy (hanging upside down) boosts hair growth

**the myth**: hanging upside down increases blood flow to the scalp, delivering more nutrients to hair follicles and accelerating growth.

**the science**: while proper blood circulation is important for healthy hair growth, temporarily increasing blood flow through inversion doesn't translate to measurable changes in hair growth rates. hair growth is a complex process influenced by numerous factors beyond just blood flow.

**the truth**: no scientific studies support the claim that inversion therapy increases hair growth. any perceived benefits are likely placebo effects or coincidental timing with natural growth cycles.

**what actually helps**: instead of temporary measures like inversion, focus on sustained improvements to circulation through regular exercise, scalp massage, and clinically-validated methods like red light therapy, which has been shown to enhance microcirculation to the follicles.

## myth #4: stress causes gray hair that can be reversed

**the myth**: stress turns hair gray, and eliminating stress can restore natural color.

**the science**: the relationship between stress and graying is complex. a 2020 study published in *nature* did establish that stress hormones can affect the melanocyte stem cells responsible for hair pigmentation. however, once these cells are depleted and hair turns gray, the process cannot be reversed through stress reduction alone.

**the truth**: while chronic stress may accelerate graying by depleting pigment-producing cells, removing stress won't restore color to already gray hair. each hair follicle follows its own timeline, and once it produces gray hair, it will continue to do so regardless of stress levels.

**what actually helps**: managing stress is beneficial for overall hair health and may slow premature graying, but won't reverse existing gray hair. embrace the gray or seek coloring options if you prefer to cover it.

## myth #5: natural oils can "wake up" dormant follicles

**the myth**: applying oils like castor, rosemary, or peppermint to the scalp can reactivate dormant follicles and grow hair in bald areas.

**the science**: while certain natural oils have beneficial properties—rosemary oil, for instance, has been compared to minoxidil in some small studies—their ability to revive completely dormant follicles is limited. hair follicles that have been dormant for extended periods or that have undergone miniaturization in pattern baldness often require more targeted interventions.

**the truth**: topical oils may provide benefits for scalp health, but they cannot "resurrect" follicles that have stopped functioning entirely. depending on the stage of hair loss, the effectiveness of oils varies significantly.

**what actually helps**: for early-stage hair thinning, a combination approach including scientifically-backed treatments like red light therapy, appropriate medications if prescribed, and supportive natural remedies typically yields the best results. for advanced hair loss, set realistic expectations about what topical treatments alone can achieve.

## myth #6: washing hair less frequently promotes growth

**the myth**: daily washing strips the scalp of natural oils, leading to drier, thinner hair. washing less frequently allows these oils to nourish the follicles and promote growth.

**the science**: washing frequency should be determined by your hair type, scalp condition, lifestyle, and environment. while over-washing can potentially cause dryness and brittleness in some hair types, under-washing can lead to buildup that clogs follicles and impedes healthy growth.

**the truth**: there's no universal rule for washing frequency. what matters most is keeping the scalp clean, balanced, and free from excessive buildup that could interfere with follicle function. 

**what actually helps**: determine your optimal washing schedule based on your specific needs. use gentle, sulfate-free shampoos that clean effectively without stripping essential moisture. focus on scalp health rather than arbitrary rules about frequency.

## myth #7: hair grows faster in summer than winter

**the myth**: hair grows more quickly during summer months due to increased circulation from warmer weather.

**the science**: a 2009 study in the *british journal of dermatology* did find slight seasonal variations in human hair growth, with rates peaking in summer. however, the difference was minimal—approximately 0.1mm per day faster—and not noticeable in practical terms.

**the truth**: while there may be a scientifically measurable seasonal effect, the difference is so slight that it has no meaningful impact on your hair growth journey. other factors, like genetics and overall health, have far greater influence on growth rates.

**what actually helps**: rather than waiting for summer, focus on year-round hair health through proper nutrition, scalp care, and evidence-based growth-promoting treatments like red light therapy, which can be used regardless of season.

## myth #8: certain hairstyles or products can increase hair thickness

**the myth**: specific hairstyles, products, or treatments can permanently increase the thickness of individual hair strands.

**the science**: each hair's thickness is determined by the size and shape of the follicle that produces it, which is largely genetic. while products can temporarily create the appearance of fuller hair through coating or swelling the hair shaft, they cannot fundamentally change the diameter of new growth emerging from the follicle.

**the truth**: products advertising "thickening" effects work through temporary cosmetic effects that wash away, or by reducing breakage so that hair appears fuller over time. no topical product can permanently increase the diameter of your individual hair strands.

**what actually helps**: for a scientifically-validated approach to improving hair thickness, technologies like red light therapy have been shown to influence the hair growth cycle, potentially leading to measurable improvements in hair diameter and density through biological mechanisms rather than cosmetic effects.

## how to make evidence-based decisions about hair care

with so much misinformation circulating about hair growth, how can you determine what's worth your time and investment? consider these guidelines:

1. **seek peer-reviewed research**: look for hair care approaches backed by published scientific studies, not just anecdotal claims
2. **understand the mechanism**: be skeptical of products that don't clearly explain how they work or make claims that defy basic biology
3. **check for clinical evidence**: treatments like red light therapy have clinical trials supporting their efficacy for hair growth
4. **consider the source**: information from dermatologists, trichologists, and reputable health organizations carries more weight than unverified internet claims
5. **be realistic about timeframes**: hair grows slowly; any product promising dramatic results in days or weeks is likely exaggerating

## the care<span style="color:#FF5A36; font-size:0.8em; vertical-align:top; margin-left:1px; margin-right:1px;">•</span>atin approach: science over myths

at care<span style="color:#FF5A36; font-size:0.8em; vertical-align:top; margin-left:1px; margin-right:1px;">•</span>atin, our approach to hair health is grounded in photobiomodulation science—the use of specific light wavelengths to stimulate cellular function in hair follicles. this technology has been validated through multiple clinical studies showing improvements in hair count, thickness, and growth rate.

rather than relying on myths or temporary cosmetic fixes, we focus on addressing the biological mechanisms of hair growth at the cellular level. our red light therapy devices deliver precise wavelengths that:

- enhance cellular energy production in follicles
- improve microcirculation to the scalp
- reduce inflammation that can impede growth
- optimize the hair growth cycle for improved density

## conclusion: moving beyond myths to science-based hair care

while myths about hair growth often promise quick fixes and miraculous results, the reality of hair biology is more complex. by understanding the science behind hair growth and choosing approaches with genuine scientific backing, you can make more effective decisions about your hair care routine.

we encourage you to question popular beliefs, seek evidence-based information, and prioritize treatments with proven mechanisms of action over those based on tradition or trend. your hair deserves care that's grounded in science, not superstition.
