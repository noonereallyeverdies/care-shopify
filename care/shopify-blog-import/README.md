# Setting Up Your Shopify Blog

This folder contains HTML content for your Shopify blog. Follow these steps to set up your blog properly.

## Step 1: Create a Blog in Shopify Admin

1. Go to your Shopify Admin
2. Navigate to **Online Store > Blog Posts**
3. If you don't have a blog set up yet, click **Create blog**
4. **Critical:** Name your blog "Journal" (must be exactly this name)
5. Save the blog

## Step 2: Upload the Founder Image

1. In your Shopify Admin, go to **Settings > Files**
2. Upload the founder image (placeholder or your actual founder image)
3. Copy the URL of the uploaded image
4. Update the image URL in the blog HTML files

## Step 3: Create Your First Blog Post

1. In Shopify Admin, go to **Online Store > Blog Posts**
2. Click **Add blog post**
3. Title: "A Journey of Love and Resilience: The care•atin Story"
4. For the content, click the `</>` HTML button in the editor
5. Copy and paste the entire HTML content from `inspiration-story.html`
6. Update the image URL to your uploaded founder image
7. Add SEO title and description:
   - SEO title: "Our Founder's Story: From Personal Struggle to Hair Transformation"
   - SEO description: "Discover how care•atin's founder developed our red light therapy device after watching her aunt's cancer journey and facing her own hair challenges."
8. Add relevant tags: "founder story", "about us", "red light therapy", "hair growth"
9. Publish the post

## Step 4: Verify the Blog Setup

1. Visit your store URL and go to `/blogs/journal`
2. Ensure the blog is accessible and displays the post correctly
3. Check individual post URLs to confirm they're working

## Troubleshooting

If your blog or posts don't appear:

1. Verify the blog is named exactly "Journal" (case sensitive)
2. Check that the post is published and not just saved as a draft
3. Make sure your theme supports blogs (most do by default)
4. Clear your cache or try in an incognito window

## Adding More Blog Posts

You can create additional blog posts following the same process. We recommend focusing on:

1. Hair science content
2. Red light therapy research
3. Customer success stories
4. Hair care tips and product guides

Keep blog posts between 800-1500 words for optimal SEO and reader engagement.
