# your personalized hair balance plan
## for oily hair with scalp concerns

dear {{name}},

thank you for completing our hair assessment. based on your responses at {{age}}, i've created this custom guide to help you address your oily hair and scalp concerns using red light therapy and targeted care practices.

### your hair profile
- **hair type:** normal to fine with excess oil production
- **primary concerns:** oily scalp, potential flaking, and limp roots
- **contributing factors:** hormonal influences, over-washing, and product buildup

### your custom care•atin routine

#### treatment schedule
For optimal balancing of your scalp with your care•atin device:
- **weeks 1-4:** daily treatments (5 minutes each, focusing on scalp coverage)
- **weeks 5-12:** 4 treatments per week (5 minutes each)
- **maintenance:** 2-3 treatments per week once desired balance is achieved

#### complementary care

**targeted cleansing approach:**
- use a gentle clarifying shampoo 2-3 times per week
- incorporate a salicylic acid scalp treatment once weekly
- perform a monthly deep detox with a clay-based hair mask

**balanced conditioning strategy:**
- apply lightweight conditioner to mid-lengths and ends only, avoiding the scalp
- use a weightless leave-in spray for detangling
- incorporate a weekly scalp tonic with witch hazel or tea tree oil

**strategic styling:**
- minimize use of silicone-heavy products that can build up on scalp
- utilize dry shampoo proactively (apply before bed rather than after oil appears)
- position hair dryer 6 inches from scalp to avoid stimulating excess oil production

**internal balance support:**
- reduce consumption of dairy and high-glycemic foods
- increase zinc-rich foods (pumpkin seeds, chickpeas, oysters)
- ensure adequate B-vitamin intake through leafy greens and whole grains

### expected timeline for your scalp rebalancing journey

**weeks 1-4: regulation phase**
- initial adjustment period (scalp may temporarily produce more oil)
- subtle reduction in scalp inflammation and discomfort
- beginning normalization of oil production patterns

**weeks 5-8: balancing phase**
- noticeable extension between necessary wash days
- reduced flaking and irritation
- improved hair body and volume at the roots

**weeks 9-12: harmony phase**
- significant regulation of oil production
- consistent scalp comfort without flaking or irritation
- enhanced overall hair appearance with natural volume

**beyond week 12: maintenance phase**
- stabilized oil production at healthy levels
- minimal scalp concerns with occasional check-ins
- consistent day-to-day manageability with less styling effort

### personalized recommendations

based on your specific concern about {{specific_concern}}, i recommend focusing on:

1. **evening scalp routine:** introduce a 3-minute dry brush scalp massage before bed to distribute oils and improve circulation
2. **weekly clarifying treatment:** alternate between apple cider vinegar rinses (1 tbsp in 2 cups water) and enzyme-based scalp treatments
3. **strategic product application:** adopt a "scalp care first" approach, treating your scalp as an extension of your facial skincare
4. **environmental protection:** use a UV protectant spray when outdoors for extended periods to prevent solar damage to scalp

with consistent use of your care•atin device and this balanced approach, you should notice your scalp becoming significantly more balanced within 60-90 days, with the most noticeable improvements beginning around week 6.

i'm here to support you throughout your journey to a healthier, more balanced scalp and hair. feel free to reach out with any questions along the way.

for healthy hair from root to tip,
