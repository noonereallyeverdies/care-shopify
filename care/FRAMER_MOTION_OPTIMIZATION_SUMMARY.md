### Animation Categories
1. **Simple** (Can replace): 49 files
   - Basic hover effects (scale, opacity)
   - Fade in/out animations
   - Simple accordions

2. **Complex** (Keep Framer Motion): 23 files
   - Scroll-triggered animations (`useScroll`)
   - Physics-based springs
   - Complex gestures and drag

## üîß Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (Immediate)
