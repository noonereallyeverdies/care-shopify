# Landing Page Debugging Status

## 🔍 Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. Missing Assets (✅ FIXED)
- **Created grid.svg**: Added the missing grid.svg file to `/public/images/`
- **Removed font references**: Updated CSS to remove references to missing Inter font files
- **Updated background images**: Removed references to non-existent background images

### 2. React Hook Errors (🔄 IN PROGRESS)
The error `Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')` suggests:
- React renderer context issue
- Possible version mismatch between React and React DOM
- Hydration mismatch between server and client

### 3. Hydration Mismatch (🔄 RELATED)
- Server-side rendering doesn't match client-side rendering
- Usually caused by dynamic content (dates, random numbers) or conditional rendering

## 🛠️ Current State

### Simplified Implementation
1. **Created SimpleHero component** - Removed complex useState hooks
2. **Simplified route** - Minimal implementation without complex state
3. **Removed dynamic content** - Eliminated countdown timers and real-time updates

### Test Route Created
Created a minimal test route to isolate the React hook issue.

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Gradual Build-Up
1. Start with the minimal route (currently implemented)
2. Add components one by one to isolate the problematic component
3. Gradually add complexity back

### Option 2: Check Dependencies
1. Verify React and React DOM versions match
2. Check for duplicate React instances
3. Ensure Framer Motion is compatible with current React version

### Option 3: Alternative Implementation
1. Remove Framer Motion temporarily
2. Use CSS animations instead
3. Implement state management differently (no useState in components)

## 🔧 Recommended Debugging Steps

1. **Test current minimal route** - Verify it loads without errors
2. **Add SimpleHero component back** - Check if it works
3. **Add other sections one by one** - Identify the problematic component
4. **Check React versions**:
   ```bash
   npm list react react-dom @remix-run/react
   ```

## 📝 Notes

- The premium design and neuromarketing features are ready
- All components are created and available
- The issue is likely in the React setup, not the component logic
- Once the React issue is resolved, we can implement the full premium landing page

## 🚀 Quick Test

Try accessing the landing page now - it should show a simple "Coming Soon" message without errors. If this works, we can gradually add components back.
