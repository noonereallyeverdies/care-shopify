# Developer Guidance: Building Care-atin (RLT for Hair)

This guidance distills the brand strategy and competitive analysis into specific, actionable instructions for building the `care-atin` website on Shopify, focusing on Red Light Therapy for Hair.

**I. Technical Foundation & Theming:**

1.  **Platform:** Build within Shopify, utilizing its Section architecture for modularity and content management.
2.  **CSS Variables:** Implement the defined `care-atin` color palette **rigorously** using CSS variables in `:root`. This is non-negotiable for consistency and maintainability.
    *   `--c-primary-[name]` (Neutrals: whites, greys, charcoal/navy) - Dominant colors for backgrounds, core text, borders.
    *   `--c-secondary-nature-[name]` (Subtle greens, beiges) - Use **sparingly** for accents within specific content blocks related to scalp health or natural processes (e.g., icon backgrounds, specific callouts). **Do not** use as a broad secondary theme.
    *   `--c-accent-rlt` (Defined luminous RLT color: coral, gold, etc.) - Reserve **strategically** for:
        *   Primary Call-to-Action buttons (Shop, Add to Cart).
        *   Interactive element states (hover, focus on links/buttons).
        *   Highlighting key scientific data points or icons.
        *   Subtle microinteraction effects (see below).
3.  **Typography Implementation:**
    *   Load the chosen primary Sans-Serif (for body/UI) and heading Serif/Sans-Serif fonts. Use Shopify's font loading or a reliable method like Google Fonts API.
    *   Define font families, weights, and sizes using CSS variables (`--font-body-family`, `--font-heading-family`, `--font-size-base`, etc.).
    *   **Preload** any custom/local font files (like Omiwell's `Feature Display Web`) for performance. Use `font-display: swap;`.
    *   **Crucially:** Establish and enforce a strict typographic scale for headings (H1-H6), body text, captions, etc., to ensure visual hierarchy and readability.

**II. Layout, Structure & Organization (Homepage Focus):**

*   **Goal:** Guide the user logically: Problem Awareness -> Solution (RLT) -> How it Works -> Proof -> Product -> Purchase.
*   **Overall Layout:** Clean, spacious, leveraging whitespace (inspired by Solawave's clarity). Use a standard container width with potential full-width sections for visual impact (e.g., hero, specific background treatments).
*   **Key Homepage Sections to Build:**
    1.  **Hero Section:**
        *   **Visual:** High-quality, professional image/video clearly showing the `care-atin` device *and* aspirational healthy hair. Avoid clutter. Consider subtle, elegant animation if using static imagery.
        *   **Content:** Clear, concise headline: "Red Light Therapy for Healthier, Fuller Hair." Short supporting text reinforcing the core benefit.
        *   **CTA:** Prominent button(s) using `--c-accent-rlt` ("Shop the Device," "How RLT Works").
    2.  **Problem/Solution:** Briefly address common hair concerns (visually using icons + short text) and position the `care-atin` RLT device as the targeted solution.
    3.  **How It Works (Snippet):** Visually engaging section (diagrams, icons using accent/neutral colors) explaining the *core mechanism* of RLT on follicles simply. Link to a dedicated "Science" page. Highlight 2-3 key benefits (e.g., Boosts Circulation, Energizes Follicles).
    4.  **Device Spotlight:** Clean section showcasing the physical product. High-res images, potentially a 360Â° view or short video loop. Highlight 2-3 key *physical* features/design aspects using icons/short text.
    5.  **Proof/Results:**
        *   **Testimonial Slider:** Implement a smooth, touch-friendly carousel (e.g., using GlideJS like Omiwell, or a similar library like SwiperJS) showcasing concise customer quotes focused on *hair results*. Include names and potentially star ratings.
        *   **Before/After:** Consider integrating a simple, clear Before/After visual component (like Omiwell's, but potentially simpler). Ensure ethical representation and clear labeling of timeframes.
        *   **Social Proof Logos:** "As Seen In" or expert endorsement logos (if applicable).
    6.  **(Optional) Supporting Products:** If applicable, a *subtle* section introducing synergistic topicals, clearly framed as *enhancing* the RLT device. Link to relevant products/bundles.
    7.  **Final CTA:** Reinforce the core purchase or learning action.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   Implement a **sticky header** (like Omiwell/Solawave) for persistent navigation.
    *   Keep navigation items focused: `The Device`, `How It Works` / `The Science`, `Results`, `Shop`, `Support`. Avoid generic terms that dilute the RLT focus.
    *   Ensure clear visual states for active/hovered links.

**III. Visual Improvements & Component Styling:**

1.  **"Radiance/Glow" Execution:** Implement this **subtly** and with high quality:
    *   **Microinteractions:** Use the `--c-accent-rlt` for subtle button press feedback (slight scale/color change), loading spinners, or progress indicators. A faint glow effect on *active* navigation items or focused form inputs *can* work if minimal and sharp.
    *   **Backgrounds:** Avoid large, static gradients unless executed professionally as part of a specific section background (e.g., a very light radial gradient behind a "Results" heading). Test thoroughly.
    *   **Image Treatments:** Generally avoid artificial lens flares. A subtle, realistic sheen on product photography is acceptable if done professionally.
2.  **Buttons:** Style buttons consistently: Primary (solid fill, `--c-accent-rlt`), Secondary (outline or neutral fill), Tertiary (text links). Ensure adequate padding for clickability and visual balance. Add subtle hover transitions (fade, slight lift).
3.  **Product Cards (if used for bundles/topicals):** Standardize layout. Ensure the RLT device is always visually prioritized if shown alongside topicals.
4.  **Forms:** Clean, simple input fields, clear labels, visible focus states (`outline` using accent or primary dark color).
5.  **Iconography:** Implement the custom icon set consistently across the site. Ensure icons are crisp (SVG preferred) and visually aligned with the clean, tech-meets-nature aesthetic.
6.  **Spacing:** Use consistent spacing values (defined via CSS variables, e.g., `--space-xs`, `--space-sm`, `--section-padding`) for margins, padding, and vertical rhythm between sections (like Omiwell's `--section-spacing`). This dramatically improves visual organization.

**IV. Performance & Optimization:**

1.  **Image Optimization:** Use `srcset` for responsive images, `loading="lazy"` attribute, and modern formats (WebP). Ensure images are appropriately sized.
2.  **Resource Hints:** Implement `preconnect` for critical third-party domains (Shopify CDN, Google Fonts, analytics platforms) like Solawave.
3.  **Asset Loading:** Load CSS/JS efficiently. Preload critical assets (main CSS, JS, fonts). Use `async` or `defer` for non-critical third-party scripts (tracking pixels, non-essential app scripts) to avoid render-blocking.
4.  **Minimize App Bloat:** While apps are needed (reviews, etc.), be mindful of the performance impact seen on sites like Omiwell. Prioritize essential apps for launch.

**V. Tracking & Accessibility:**

1.  **Tracking:** Set up Google Tag Manager (GTM) as the container. Configure GA4, relevant ad pixels (Meta, etc.) via GTM or Shopify's Web Pixels Manager.
2.  **Accessibility:** Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<footer>`, `<section>`, `<article>`). Add `alt` text to all meaningful images. Ensure basic keyboard navigation. Test color contrast, especially for text over neutral backgrounds and accent colors. Decide on approach vs. overlay widgets (like Solawave/Omiwell use).

**Summary for Developer:** Focus on building a clean, fast, trustworthy Shopify site that clearly communicates the value of `care-atin`'s RLT device for hair. Prioritize visual hierarchy, consistent styling via CSS variables, high-quality assets, and strategic use of the accent color. Leverage components like testimonial sliders and before/after visuals effectively for social proof. Ensure the user journey from understanding the science to seeing results and purchasing the device is seamless and compelling.
