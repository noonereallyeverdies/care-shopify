# Fixes Applied

I've addressed several issues in the codebase:

## 1. Fixed the TestimonialsSection Component

There was a syntax error in `TestimonialsSection.tsx` that was causing build errors. I have:
- Restructured the entire file with proper syntax
- Converted it to use a default export instead of named export
- Fixed the incomplete component implementation

## 2. Fixed Duplicate GraphQL Query Names

Resolved the warning about duplicate query names:
- Renamed `ProductQuery` to `MainProductQuery` in the main index.tsx file
- This prevents conflicts with the query in index.fixed.tsx

## 3. Updated Import in Index.tsx

Updated the import statement for TestimonialsSection in index.tsx:
- Changed from importing a named export to a default export
- This matches the new structure of the TestimonialsSection component

## 4. Created Fonts Directory

Created a missing fonts directory in the public folder:
- This should help resolve the 404 errors for font files
- You will need to add the actual font files to this directory

## Required Follow-up Actions

Please add the following font files to the `/public/fonts` directory:
- IBMPlexSerif-Text.woff2
- IBMPlexSerif-TextItalic.woff2

These fonts are being requested by the application but are not present in the repository, causing 404 errors.
