# Navigation Fixes Applied to Your Hydrogen App

## Summary of Issues Fixed

### 1. **Locale-Based Routing Issues**
- **Problem**: The app uses locale-based routing (`/en-us/cart`) but navigation links were pointing to non-locale routes (`/cart`)
- **Solution**: Created a `NavigationContext` and `LocalizedLink/LocalizedNavLink` components that automatically prepend the current locale to all navigation URLs

### 2. **Missing useAside Hook**
- **Problem**: The Header component was trying to use `useAside()` but it wasn't defined
- **Solution**: Created an `AsideProvider` and `useAside` hook to manage aside/drawer state throughout the app

### 3. **Cart Integration Issues**
- **Problem**: Cart routes weren't properly integrated with the locale system
- **Solution**: Updated `CartFormWrapper` to detect and use the current locale when submitting cart actions

### 4. **Navigation Context**
- **Problem**: No centralized way to handle locale-aware navigation
- **Solution**: Created a `NavigationProvider` that wraps the entire app and provides locale utilities

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created:
1. `/app/components/Aside.tsx` - Provides aside/drawer context
2. `/app/contexts/NavigationContext.tsx` - Manages locale-aware navigation
3. `/app/components/LocalizedLink.tsx` - Locale-aware link components
4. `/app/lib/locale-utils.ts` - Utility functions for locale handling

### Files Modified:
1. `/app/components/Layout/Header.tsx` - Updated to use LocalizedLink components
2. `/app/components/PageLayout.tsx` - Added NavigationProvider and AsideProvider
3. `/app/components/CartFormWrapper.tsx` - Updated to handle locale-based cart routes

## How It Works Now

1. **Automatic Locale Detection**: The app detects the current locale from the URL (e.g., `/en-us/`)
2. **Locale-Aware Links**: All navigation links automatically prepend the current locale
3. **Cart Integration**: Cart actions are submitted to the correct locale-based route
4. **Mobile Menu**: Fixed to properly close when navigating

## Navigation Routes

All navigation now correctly points to locale-prefixed routes:
- Homepage: `/en-us`
- Shop: `/en-us/collections/all`
- The Science: `/en-us/pages/science`
- Our Story: `/en-us/pages/our-story`
- Hair Quiz: `/en-us/pages/hair-quiz`
- Journal: `/en-us/blogs/news`
- Cart: `/en-us/cart`
- Search: `/en-us/search`
- Account: `/en-us/account`

## Testing

The application is now running on http://localhost:3003/

To test:
1. Click on any navigation link - it should properly navigate with the locale prefix
2. Try the cart button - it should navigate to `/en-us/cart`
3. Test the mobile menu - links should work and the menu should close after navigation
4. Add items to cart - the cart form should submit to the correct locale-based route

## Additional Notes

- The solution is flexible and supports multiple locales (en-us, en-ca, es-mx, fr-ca, etc.)
- The locale is automatically detected from the current URL
- All links are automatically localized without needing to manually specify the locale
- The cart integration properly handles locale-based routing for all cart actions
