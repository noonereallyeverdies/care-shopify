# Care App Migration Guide

This document provides instructions for completing the migration from `theapp` to `new-hydrogen-app`.

## Migration Status

The migration from `theapp` to `new-hydrogen-app` is nearly complete. The following steps will help finalize the process and resolve the Node.js module issues.

## 1. Verify Migration

Run the verification script to check that all necessary files have been migrated:

```bash
cd /Users/yvonne/Desktop/care/new-hydrogen-app
./verify-migration.sh
```

This will show you which files and directories have been successfully migrated and which ones still need attention.

## 2. Copy Testimonial Images

Run the testimonial copy script to ensure all testimonial images are available:

```bash
cd /Users/yvonne/Desktop/care/new-hydrogen-app
./copy-testimonials.sh
```

This script will copy existing testimonial images and create placeholders for any missing images.

## 3. Complete Setup and Fix Node.js Module Issues

Run the complete setup script to finalize the migration and fix the Node.js module resolution issues:

```bash
cd /Users/yvonne/Desktop/care/new-hydrogen-app
./complete-setup.sh
```

This script will:
- Create a simplified Vite configuration that properly handles Node.js modules
- Set up the necessary directory structure for images
- Fix the HeroSection import path in the landing page component
- Create a clean start script for running the application

## 4. Start the Application

After completing the setup, start the application using the clean start script:

```bash
cd /Users/yvonne/Desktop/care/new-hydrogen-app
./clean-start.sh
```

This will start the Hydrogen app on port 4000 with proper memory limits and debugging enabled.

## Important Notes

1. **Do not delete the original `theapp` folder yet**. Keep it until you've verified that the new app works correctly.

2. **Check the web console for errors** when running the application. If you see any missing imports or assets, you may need to make additional adjustments.

3. **Testing is crucial**. Make sure to test all aspects of the landing page to ensure everything renders correctly.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Node.js Module Errors**: The `complete-setup.sh` script should fix these, but if you still encounter errors, you may need to manually adjust the Vite configuration or install additional polyfills.

2. **Missing Components**: If components are missing or not rendering correctly, check the import paths in the relevant files.

3. **Missing Assets**: If images or other assets are not loading, make sure they've been copied to the correct location in the new app.

4. **Build Errors**: If you see build errors, check the console output for clues. You may need to adjust the Vite configuration or make changes to specific components.

## Next Steps

After verifying that the new app works correctly:

1. Update any documentation to reflect the new application structure.
2. Consider creating a backup of the original `theapp` folder before deleting it.
3. Update any deployment scripts or CI/CD configurations to use the new application.
