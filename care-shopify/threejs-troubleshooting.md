# React Three Fiber Troubleshooting Guide

This document outlines potential issues with the 3D model integration in the Care•atin landing page and provides step-by-step solutions to address each problem.

## Identified Issues

The primary error occurs in the `<Canvas>` component from React Three Fiber, which is used in our `DeviceScene` component. The error propagates through the component tree:

```
Error in <ForwardRef(Canvas)> component
```

## Implemented Solutions

### ✅ 1. Fixed React Three Fiber Compatibility with Remix

**Solution Implemented:**
- Removed 'use client' directive that was causing issues in Remix
- Ensured Three.js rendering happens exclusively on the client side with `ClientOnly`
- Created a proper client-side only wrapper

### ✅ 2. Corrected Three.js Version Conflicts

**Solution Implemented:**
- Installed specific compatible versions:
  - three@0.150.1
  - @react-three/fiber@8.13.4 
  - @react-three/drei@9.80.1

### ✅ 3. Improved Canvas Initialization

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added error handling around Canvas initialization with `onError` callback
- Added `try/catch` blocks to handle initialization errors
- Simplified Canvas configuration with `flat` and `legacy` options

### ✅ 4. Simplified Test Scene

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created a minimal test scene (SimpleTestScene) to isolate issues
- Added proper error boundaries around Three.js components
- Will test with simple geometry before attempting to load complex models

### ✅ 5. Fixed Suspense Implementation

**Solution Implemented:**
- Added proper suspense boundaries with fallback UIs
- Ensured lazy loading is properly handled

### ✅ 6. Added WebGL Detection

**Solution Implemented:**
- Created a WebGLDetector utility to check compatibility before rendering
- Added nice fallback experience for browsers without WebGL
- Added debugging panel for WebGL information

## New Issues Discovered

### 7. Content Security Policy (CSP) Violations

**Issue:** The application is encountering CSP violations when loading fonts as data URLs:
```
Refused to load the font 'data:application/font-woff;charset=utf-8;base64...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive
```

**Solution:**
- Add `font-src data:` to the CSP to allow data URL fonts
- Alternatively, host the fonts as static files instead of using data URLs
- Check which library is using data URL fonts (likely in React Three Fiber or a dependent package)

### 8. React Hook Errors and Hydration Issues

**Issue:** The application is encountering React hook errors and hydration mismatches:
```
Invalid hook call. Hooks can only be called inside of the body of a function component.
Cannot read properties of null (reading 'useState')
Error: There was an error while hydrating.
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure there's only one version of React in the dependency tree:
  ```bash
  npm ls react
  ```
- Fix server/client rendering mismatch by:
  - Using `ClientOnly` component to wrap all Three.js related code
  - Ensuring no Three.js code runs during server-side rendering
  - Adding proper error boundaries at the root level
- Check for React context nesting issues across component boundaries

### 9. React Double Rendering

**Issue:** Error suggests issues with React either being loaded twice or having mismatches between server and client rendering:
```
You might have more than one copy of React in the same app
```

**Solution:**
- Ensure all Three.js code is loaded exclusively on the client side
- Use dynamic imports with proper error boundaries
- Consider modifying Remix's entry point to disable server rendering for Three.js components

## Next Steps

### 1. Fix React Hook and Hydration Issues

Before attempting to debug the SimpleTestScene further:
- Verify React dependency versions are consistent
- Ensure proper client-side only rendering with robust error handling
- Add `font-src data:` to CSP header in the server configuration

### 2. Test and Debug SimpleTestScene

Once React issues are resolved:
- Check WebGL compatibility issues in the debug panel
- Look for console errors related specifically to Three.js
- Monitor performance issues

### 3. Apply Working Solutions to DeviceScene

Once SimpleTestScene is working reliably:
- Update DeviceScene with the same error handling patterns
- Apply the same Canvas configuration optimizations
- Add appropriate fallback UIs

### 4. Progressively Add Complex Features

- First render a simple placeholder model
- Then try loading the actual GLB file
- Add lighting one step at a time
- Test performance at each step

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Implement Feature Detection**: Already created WebGLDetector, use it consistently

2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Offer a basic experience that works everywhere, enhanced with 3D when supported

3. **Performance Metrics**: Monitor performance and loading times on various devices

4. **Fallback Strategy**: Image-based fallbacks are ready for non-compatible browsers
